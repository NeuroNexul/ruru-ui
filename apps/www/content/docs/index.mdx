This is **NOT** a component library in the traditional sense. It's a collection of reusable components that you can directly copy and paste into your apps.

Our approach gives you full ownership and control over the code. By copying and pasting the components, you have the freedom to build and style them as you wish. This method allows you to start with sensible defaults and then tailor the components to your specific needs.

Packaging components as an npm dependency often couples their style with their implementation, which can be limiting. We believe that design and implementation should be separate.
