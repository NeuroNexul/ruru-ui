import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';


## Install Dependencies

First, you'll need to install **ruru UI** and its peer dependencies. You can do this using npm or yarn:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @ruru/ui
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install @ruru/ui
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @ruru/ui
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add @ruru/ui
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Import Styles

Next, you'll need to import **ruru UI**'s styles into your project. You can do this by including the following line in your main stylesheet:

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import "@ruru/ui/style.css";
```

## Usage

Now that you've installed **ruru UI** and imported its styles, you can start using the components in your project. Here's an example of how you can use a button component:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Button } from "@ruru/ui";

function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

That's it! You're now ready to start building beautiful interfaces with **ruru UI**. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to us on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ruru-m07/ruru-ui/discussions/3).
